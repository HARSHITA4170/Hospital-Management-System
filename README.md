# Hospital-Management-System
Efficient and accurate management of hospital operations is crucial for 
delivering timely and quality healthcare services. Traditional paper-based 
systems and fragmented digital records lead to data redundancy, delays, and 
increased chances of human error. Hospitals need a centralized digital solution 
that allows for the secure storage, retrieval, and management of patient data, 
medical history, appointments, treatments, billing, pharmacy stock, and staff 
details in a unified manner. 

To address this,I have designed a relational database for a Hospital 
Management System that integrates all essential entities such as patients, 
doctors, appointments, medical history, diagnoses, treatments, billing, and staff. 
The system ensures data consistency, supports quick access to patient records, 
simplifies scheduling and billing, and allows for better tracking of medicine 
inventory and staff roles. This database lays the foundation for building scalable 
applications to streamline hospital workflows and improve healthcareÂ quality.
